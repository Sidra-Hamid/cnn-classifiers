# Machine Learning Projects: Cats vs. Dogs and Brain Tumor Classification

## Projects Overview

### 1. Cats vs. Dogs Classification
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset consists of labeled images divided into training and test sets. The model is trained to distinguish between the two categories with high accuracy.

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: Contains images of cats and dogs.
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a deep CNN with several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.
- **Training**: Includes data augmentation and regularization techniques to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the model using accuracy and loss metrics.

### 2. Brain Tumor Classification
This project involves developing a CNN to classify MRI images of brain tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary. The dataset is organized into labeled folders for each category.

#### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: Consists of MRI images labeled by tumor type.
- **Model Architecture**: Employs a robust CNN architecture tailored for medical image analysis.
- **Training**: Implements advanced techniques such as dropout and batch normalization.
- **Evaluation**: Measures performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
